## About

Year 2999. New Jersey was abandoned in 2669 when the rich fled off-world and the poor stayed behind. Three centuries of isolation, mutation, and petty political violence later — six warring city-states control what remains of the Garden State. You start with nothing but a name, a faction, and an empty college campus.

Unite the wasteland. Conquer it. Or get eaten by something in the Pine Barrens.
